                    <li>Sea salt</li>
                    <li>Optional: 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, parsley, or basil</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to high broil (or medium if you have the ability) and position a rack at the top of the oven</li>
                    <li><p>Slice your eggplant into 1/4 inch rounds and sprinkle with sea salt and place in a calendar in the sink to drain any excess liquid.</p>
                        <p>After 10 minutes, rinse slightly and then pat dry between two towels.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Arrange on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil and a pinch of sea salt. Roast for 5-10 minutes, turning once or twice, until the eggplants</p>
                        <p>is softened and golden brown. Remove from pan, stack and wrap the rounds in foil to lock in moisture - wait 5 minutes.</p></li>
                    <li>Peel away most of the skin of the eggplant (a little is OK) and add flesh to a food processor. It shoukd be soft and tender and the skin should come off easy.</li>
                    <li><p>Add Lemon juice, garlic, tahini,a pinch of salt and mix until creamy. Add herbs last and pulse to incorporate. Taste and adjust seasonings</p>
                        <p>as needed. Sometimes it can be better to add a bit more tahini, some extra salt, etc.</p></li>
                    <li>Serve with pita and/or pita chips or veggies (for a gluten-free friendly option), and enjoy!. This dish can last in the fridge for several days if kept covered.</li>
                </ol>
